# Crisis Vehicle Management System for Emergency Response in Proximity to Healthcare Facilities

## About:
The **Crisis Vehicle Management System** is a real-time emergency response application designed to improve communication and coordination between users, ambulance services, and hospitals. It enables users to request ambulances, track their arrival, and ensure hospitals are notified in advance for better preparedness. By integrating automated communication and real-time updates, the system minimizes delays and optimizes resource allocation.  

Developed using Java with AES encryption, the system ensures secure data handling, protecting sensitive patient information during emergency response. It streamlines the entire process, from ambulance dispatch to hospital admission, ensuring a seamless and efficient medical handover. This innovative solution enhances emergency response efficiency, ultimately improving patient care and saving lives.

## Features:
### **Crisis Vehicle Management System**  

**Emergency Request & Tracking:** Users can register, request an ambulance, and track its real-time location until arrival. Once dispatched, nearby hospitals receive instant notifications to prepare for the patient.  

**Secure Data Management:** AES encryption ensures that patient records are securely stored and transmitted, protecting sensitive medical information.  

**Real-Time Communication:** The system enables seamless interaction between users, ambulance services, and hospitals, reducing delays and improving emergency response.  

**Medical Report Generation:** Upon arrival, doctors assess the patient and generate a report, which is securely shared with the ambulance service and admitting hospital.  

**Resource Optimization:** The system assigns the nearest available ambulance and directs patients to hospitals with available capacity, ensuring efficient resource allocation.  

**Emergency Alerts & Notifications:** Instant updates are sent to users, ambulance personnel, and hospitals, ensuring timely and coordinated emergency response.  

**Performance Monitoring & Visualization:** Data visualization tools track response times, hospital readiness, and overall system performance, helping to improve emergency healthcare services.
