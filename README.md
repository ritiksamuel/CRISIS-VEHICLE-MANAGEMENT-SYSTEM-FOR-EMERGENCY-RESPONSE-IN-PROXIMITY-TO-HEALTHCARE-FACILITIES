# Crisis Vehicle Management System for Emergency Response in Proximity to Healthcare Facilities

## About:
The **Crisis Vehicle Management System** is a real-time emergency response application designed to improve communication and coordination between users, ambulance services, and hospitals. It enables users to request ambulances, track their arrival, and ensure hospitals are notified in advance for better preparedness. By integrating automated communication and real-time updates, the system minimizes delays and optimizes resource allocation.  

Developed using Java with AES encryption, the system ensures secure data handling, protecting sensitive patient information during emergency response. It streamlines the entire process, from ambulance dispatch to hospital admission, ensuring a seamless and efficient medical handover. This innovative solution enhances emergency response efficiency, ultimately improving patient care and saving lives.

## Features:
### **Crisis Vehicle Management System**  

**Emergency Request & Tracking:** Users can register, request an ambulance, and track its real-time location until arrival. Once dispatched, nearby hospitals receive instant notifications to prepare for the patient.  

**Secure Data Management:** AES encryption ensures that patient records are securely stored and transmitted, protecting sensitive medical information.  

**Real-Time Communication:** The system enables seamless interaction between users, ambulance services, and hospitals, reducing delays and improving emergency response.  

**Medical Report Generation:** Upon arrival, doctors assess the patient and generate a report, which is securely shared with the ambulance service and admitting hospital.  

**Resource Optimization:** The system assigns the nearest available ambulance and directs patients to hospitals with available capacity, ensuring efficient resource allocation.  

**Emergency Alerts & Notifications:** Instant updates are sent to users, ambulance personnel, and hospitals, ensuring timely and coordinated emergency response.  

**Performance Monitoring & Visualization:** Data visualization tools track response times, hospital readiness, and overall system performance, helping to improve emergency healthcare services.

## Results:
The results of the fake news classification model will be evaluated based on several metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.

Precision: The fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances (i.e., the percentage of correctly predicted fake news articles).

Recall: The fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved (i.e., the model’s ability to detect all fake news articles).

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Confusion Matrix: A table used to describe the performance of the classification model in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Impact:
Combating Misinformation: By using this model, users can quickly detect fake news and prevent the spread of misinformation.

Promoting Trust: The model can help restore trust in online news platforms by providing users with a way to easily verify the authenticity of news articles.

Boosting Media Literacy: This tool can also serve as an educational platform, helping users understand the markers of fake news and improving media literacy.

Efficiency: Automating the process of fake news detection saves time and effort compared to manual verification.

Scalability: The model can be scaled to analyze massive datasets and could be deployed in real-time applications such as social media platforms, news websites, or browser extensions.
